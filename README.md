# Bouncy Ball Kingdom
You play as Barry, a happy kid that is not so happy. He received two birthday presents, one of them was awesome, but the other... not really.
The awesome one is a bouncy ball gun, that allows you to place bouncy balls wherever you want, the other one was that he got lost. He wants to go back to his family, and to do that, he needs to use his bouncy ball gun!
